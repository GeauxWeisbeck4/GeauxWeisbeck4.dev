My Official Website

I'm Andrew and I love coding and building beautiful websites and apps. 
I'm currently finishing up a project for a Section4 Innovation Sprint, 
so I can't complete all the details at the moment for my website,
but I need to finish my project. I will be back to working on this shortly.


<h3>Purpose of Personal Website</h3>
<p>So y'all can find me! I currently live in Raleigh, NC and love 
  living in the Research Triangle! Connect with me!<p>
<p>I'm also looking for projects to help out on. Whether paid or not, 
  you can contact me at andrew.weisbeck@gmail.com or through my website.</p>
