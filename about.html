        <h4>Life</h4>
        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p class="blackbox">
        Continuously learning every single day is the most important part of what makes me who I am. Ever since I was a child, I have always loved reading and school (for the most part). 
        I always maintained mostly A's all the way through  high school without much of a challenge. I then hopped right into an engineering program, first at Montana State in 2009. I 
        had no clue where my life is going, but I realized I made a mistake - I didn't go the college I really wanted to.
        <br>
        <br>I transferred to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 2010 and had switched from Electrical Engineering to Civil Engineering. Again, I wasn't prepared for that course load and
        though I would switch into Construction Management - which I really, really hated. In 2011, I switched into Business Administration after working at a bank for a while to afford school,
        and also had a big vision - you might think its crazy, but I'm part Native American and believe that spiritual visions are the most important guide for navigating life. My subconscious 
        was aware that I hated engineering (I was also failing) and knew I've always been naturally good at business. I also needed a degree that I could get through quickly while also working 30+ hours per week.
        <br>
        <br>I graduated from the University of Nebraska in 2014 with a Bachelor of Science with no idea what to do with my life. I navigated from my college job at Union Bank to TD Ameritrade - 
        I wasn't really into finance either. I spend the next half-decade learning how hard life is, struggled with mental health issues, and lacked any real solid direction in life. I kept getting jobs
        that didn't really help me grow the way I wanted to.
        <br>
        <br>My life changed last spring my life changed after taking an innovation/creativity course by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelleecreativity/" alt="Michael Lee Innovation">Michael Lee, Innovation and Creativity on Udemy</a>. 
        I worked in cybersecurity for 6 months, and then took two fullstack developer bootcamps on Udemy and found my calling in software and web development. I really have always loved everything
        about computers - I started getting into the No Starch Book series and began getting hands on with Linux, Cybersecurity, software, and web development. I have had so much fun learning since I found computer science.
        <br>
        <br>I am still linking and loading all my resources, but it is too vast to do right now.
        I have included a quick list below.
